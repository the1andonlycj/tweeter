## Getting Started
- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the local server using the `node run local` command in your terminal of choice.
- Direct your browser to http://localhost/8080
- Enjoy the calming colors and lack of insanity that the few pre-loaded tweets offer, before injecting a bit of your own Zen contemplation on the page. Feel free to experiment with different window sizes, too. 
- Careful not to talk to yourself for too long, though: the effects can be unpleasantly solipsistic, as excessively verbalizing your omphaloskepsis is hardly an efficient use of your time.
